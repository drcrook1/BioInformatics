# BioInformatics
This is the Web section of the project.  Here you will find 3 projects.  

BioInfo.Web.Api  This is the primary api which all web projects and client projects feed from.  This
is the back end web application and restful services which holds the keys for all interactions between
data and client applications except possibly in the case of notifications and automated tasks which will 
be called out as they are delivered.

BioInfo.Web.Admin This is the application which is responsible for adding new users, bands etc.

BioInfo.Web.External This is the application which is externally visible to all users.  Note there may still
be roles permissions.
