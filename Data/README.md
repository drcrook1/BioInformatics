# BioInformatics
This is the Data Section of the app.  This section contains all projects centered around data.  You will
find the SQL database creation scripts, stream analytics queries and machine learning algorithms.  Instructions
for how to deploy and deliver each component will reside here.

Before contributing to this project, please watch the following video to understand the very high 
level generic form of the architecture: https://aka.ms/iotanalytics 

#IMPORTANT
High level naming conventions:

Project Prefix . Primary Section . Specific High . Specific Low

BioInfo.App.Library.Analytics  would be a good example of this naming convention.

BioInfo.Web.Api.Services is another good example of this naming convention.
