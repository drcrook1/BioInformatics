# BioInformatics
This is the Client App section of the project.  In this section you will find the Xamarin portions of the
project with iOS, Android and UWP targets.  There are a series of PCL projects which are shared code across
all native targets.

The client application interacts with the Web API section, which is the "glue" that binds all sections of the
project.  There may be segments of the project which receive visuals directly from power bi.  Those
sections will be called out explicitly.

Before contributing to this project, please watch the following video to understand the very high 
level generic form of the architecture: https://aka.ms/iotanalytics
